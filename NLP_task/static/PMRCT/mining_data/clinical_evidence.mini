115 Instead, in MLL, malignant transformation requires the gain-of-function KMT2A rearrangements that lead to production of MLL fusion proteins
115 One interpretation of these data is that the re-introduction of functional p53 in these Ewing’s sarcoma cells containing EWS-FLI1 promptly leads the fusion protein to trigger a p53-dependent apoptotic program at least in vitro

12 This tissue-specific function of YAP could be the result of its interaction with p53 family proteins (p73 and p63) and transcription enhancer factor (TEF/TEAD)
12 To determine whether this high frequency is the result of the spreading of a very ancestral mutation or, alternatively, the result of a mutational hotspot associated with the phenomenon of DNA polymerase slippage (this small deletion is associated to a trinucleotide direct repeat), we performed a comprehensive haplotype analysis in a total of 28 patients sharing this mutation but belonging to geographic distant populations (Spain, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Peru, United States, United Kingdom, Portugal, Germany, Pakistan, and Nigeria)
